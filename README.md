Captured packets using wireshark and filtered UDP,TCP & ARP packets

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
ARP is a network protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address (MAC address) within a local area network.

It operates between the data link layer and the Internet layer, serving as a bridge to direct IP packets to target hardware addresses on the same subnet.

ARP enables devices to discover each other's MAC addresses to establish direct communication over wired or wireless networks.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
TCP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol in the Internet suite, providing reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between computers.

It uses a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish communication, guarantees packet sequencing, and retransmits lost segments for reliability.

TCP is used by applications requiring data integrity such as web browsing (HTTP), file transfer (FTP), and email (SMTP).

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
UDP is a connectionless transport layer protocol, emphasizing fast data transmission and low latency at the expense of reliability and ordering.

There is no handshake, retransmission, or in-order delivery; dropped or out-of-order packets are generally ignored by UDP.

UDP is used for applications like online gaming, live video streams, DNS queries, and other real-time services where speed is essential.
